<div class="container">
<div class="col">
<h3> Pros of Reveal.js</h3 >

</div>
<div class="col">
<h3> Cons of Reveal.js</h3 >

(with reveal-md)

- Limitations of styling (needs lots of CSS)

### Reveal.js

Note: Though there is no big winner, we decided to go on with Reveal.js. The VS Code integration is nicer, the community is bigger and one can influence more the backend.
